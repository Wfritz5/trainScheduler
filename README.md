# trainScheduler

https://wfritz5.github.io/trainScheduler/

This project uses JQuery, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Firebase Database and usage of Moment.js

In this project, the user will input a train name, the destination, the time of the FIRST arrival (HH:mm Military Time) and how often
the frequency of the train is.. (ex 15 = 15 minutes).

The application will then store all the information that was submitted to a Firebase Database, and calculate exactly how far the next train is, and will give a
time frame on when that specific train that was inputted will show up based off the USER's current time.
